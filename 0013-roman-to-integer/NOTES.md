To convert a Roman numeral to an integer in Java, you can follow these steps:

Create a map to store the values of each Roman numeral character.
Iterate through the string, checking the value of each character and its successor.
If the value of the current character is less than the value of the next character, subtract the current character's value from the total.
Otherwise, add the current character's value to the total.
Return the total as the result.

Explanation of the Code:
Map Initialization: We use a HashMap to store the values of the Roman numeral characters. This allows quick lookup of each character's value.

Iteration: We iterate through the string from right to left. This allows us to handle the subtraction cases (like IV, IX) more easily by comparing each character to its predecessor.

Calculation:
If the value of the current Roman numeral is less than the value of the previous Roman numeral (which we've already processed), it means we have encountered a subtraction case (e.g., IV, IX). So, we subtract the current value from the total.
Otherwise, we add the current value to the total.
Return Result: Finally, we return the total which now contains the integer value of the Roman numeral.

Example Walkthrough:
For the Roman numeral "MCMXCIV":
Start from the rightmost character:
'V' (5), total = 5
'I' (1), since 1 < 5, subtract 1, total = 4
'C' (100), since 100 > 1, add 100, total = 104
'X' (10), since 10 < 100, subtract 10, total = 94
'M' (1000), since 1000 > 100, add 1000, total = 1094
'C' (100), since 100 < 1000, subtract 100, total = 994
'M' (1000), since 1000 > 100, add 1000, total = 1994
So, "MCMXCIV" correctly converts to 1994.â€‹
