â€‹To find the length of the last word in a given string s, you can follow these steps:

Trim any trailing spaces from the string.
Split the string into words using spaces as delimiters.
Find the last word in the list of words.
Return the length of the last word.

Explanation of the Code:
Trimming the String: The trim method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that trailing spaces do not affect the calculation of the length of the last word.

Finding the Last Space: The lastIndexOf method is used to find the position of the last space character in the trimmed string. This helps to identify where the last word begins.

Calculating the Length: The length of the last word is calculated by subtracting the index of the last space from the total length of the string and then subtracting one more to account for the zero-based index.
